An app that gives users real-time weather and traffic data for specified locations.
Users are able to enter specific points of interest to them and receive current weather and traffic data for that
specific location. This allows users to quickly prepare for journeys. The app takes care of all the search requirements for them by working out their location via forward geocoding with the Open Cage Data API to produce a latitude and longitude that is then passed onto the Open Weather API and TomTom's traffic API to give the user feedback on the current weather and traffic flow at that location.
